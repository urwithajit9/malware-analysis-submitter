Submit files to the Anubis and Cwsandbox Malware Analyzers

Anubis: http://anubis.iseclab.org/
CWsandbox: https://mwanalysis.org/

Before submitting any files, make sure the system is installed properly.  Instructions for installation can be found in INSTALL.txt.

To submit files, simply place the executables in files/new and run main.py.  It is best to set up a repeated call, because the system does not do any type of waiting.  If the analysis reports are not instantly ready (which they never are), then main.py will need to be called again to download the reports.

Once files are successfuly submitted, they are moved to files/added.

The analysis reports can be found in the results directory.

In order to avoid being blacklisted, the system only makes a set number of requests per time period.  This is configurable through config.py.

Any questions, comments, and recommendations are encouraged and can be emailed to cal@louisiana.edu
